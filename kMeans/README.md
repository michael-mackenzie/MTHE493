The 3 files are split as follows:

src: contains all the code for the k-means algorithm in Python 2.7. This is the main directory used; if there have been no recent updates in src3, it's likely that there have been updates here that I haven't converted to Python 3.6
src3: contains all the code for the k-means algorithm in Python 3.6. This will (likely) be updated less frequently than src
Testing: contains .csv files corresponding to every predetermined test given to the system
