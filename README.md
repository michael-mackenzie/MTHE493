Repository for the Queen's Mathematics and Engineering Thesis 
Project. The majority of the code is found in the kMeans 
directory. An outline of the tree is as follows:

**kMeans**: contains the code for the k-means algorithm, 
implemented in both Python 2.7 and Python 3.6. Further 
descriptions of the directory specifics are found in the 
readme in that directory

**newStuff**: contains a few classes which could be used to 
describe the people in the system being examined. The method
of simply tagging the people according to which cluster they
should be in was implemented in the kMeans directory, but 
these files were kept in case they come in useful at some point
