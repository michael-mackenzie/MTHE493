**people.py** is a file which defines 3 classes of people 
according to which ad we think they will be most attracted 
to. It also defines an ad class which allows the program 
instantiating it to define where the ad lies spatially

**peopleList.py**: a file which defines a bunch of operations
we'd like to do with people, such as averaging their position.
The code is broken though, so it would have to be fixed before
it is used. I think the tagging idea in ../kMeans is better and 
is certainly much more easily implemented
